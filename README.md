# Tech Blog

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-green)

In this project, I was asked to build a CMS style blog site where other developers can publish their own content as well as comment on the posts of others. No starting code was provided and so the front and back end had to be built from scratch and to do so I utilised a numner of new packages including handlebars.js, sequalize, bcrypt and the express session npm package for authentication purposes
